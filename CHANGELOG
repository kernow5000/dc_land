<*> music example working but selector is broken :D
<*> music example added... hmm, wont work on old release

<*> vmu_icon_clear() added..

2/11/02 DC_land 0.1 released


<*> DC_land 0.1 considered release material

<*> volsweep working better, but still broke

<*> tile engine implemented into DC_land, and example

<*> YGB IS FIXED

<*> library is working ok, need to add tile engine

<*>examples are ok , volsweep and tile example are broken, as volsweep is the
	    most hardcore DC_land/libdream example we had next to pong.
